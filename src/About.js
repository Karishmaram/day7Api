What does dreaming about a girl you know mean?
If you saw a girl that you know in your dream, it symbolizes good luck. Spiritually speaking the girl is the messenger of good luck trying to foretell some future positive experience or feelings. In old folklore, a dream of a girl is a sign of romance, and seeing an ugly girl in a dream state denotes a challenging time ahead (sorry to say). Seeing a little girl that turns into something else might indicate something will be unexpected. A crying girl might (in ancient dream books) indicate money issues. Instead of making investments, improve your current strategies.

What does dreaming of a girl in a dress mean?
If you saw a girl you know in your dream in a white dress, it stands for momentary pleasure/benefit. If you saw a beautiful and young girl you know in your dream wearing a pink dress, it symbolizes joy, fortune, and prosperity. If she was an attractive, well-educated and well-dressed, it stands for personal and professional progress.
